# Machine Learning With Python

BUAN 6341
Applied Machine Learning 
Spring 2018


Over the Few Months, 
I will implement the Variour Machine Learning Algorithms with topics like

Supervised & Unsupervised Learning Introduction Regression and Classification

Linear regression

Logistic Regression

Bias variance tradeoff / overfitting, regularization

Cross validation and Support Vector Machines

Decision trees

Ensemble methods

Neural Networks

Neural Networks (cont.), Instance based learning

Unsupervised Learning (Clustering: K-Means, Expectation Maximization)

Randomized optimization, Dimensionality reduction, feature selection

Feature transformation

Reinforcement learning
